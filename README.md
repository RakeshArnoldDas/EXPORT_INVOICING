# EXPORT_INVOICING
A simple program that inputs data from the user into an excel sheet and at the same time saves buyer,seller,consignee and notify party details in excel files for quick and easy access.


The program relies on the path links to the excel files for it to function. Folllow the steps to ensure that the program runs properly. 
Step 1 - create a folder called "databases" on the local machine.
Step 2 - copy excel files- "Buyer details","Consignee details","Notify details" and "Seller details" into the folder "databases".
Step 3 - replace - 'I:/databases/Seller details.xlsx' with the file path for where the databse folder is located.

Step 4 - replace - 'I:/invoice/Invoice.xlsx' with the file path for the "Invoice" file.

This program is still a work in progress and there are a few bugs.
